## Approach 

### How do you plan to realize the output of the project? List out the main steps. 

1. Physical implementation of intelligent "luggage"：

   ​	We intend to use the outsourcing method to complete the appearance design and each hardware design of the "luggage", embed the AI development board (such as Nvidia JETSON NANO, etc.) into the luggage in order to realize various intelligent functions of the "luggage“ afterwards, and realize the wireless connection between the mobile app and the intelligent ”luggage“ through the way of UWB wireless communication.

2. App front-side functions

   ​	The artwork department will design several  front-side system of the app, followed by user research, to determine the front-side design of the app, trying to meet the various requirements of the client and make the interface friendly and simple.

3. App back-side functions

   ​	Design various databases' structures and app's interfaces through the relationships among every part of data, and develop the back-side of the app, including user registration, login and the control, monitoring  function of the smart "luggage".

4. the intelligent algorithm of "luggage"

   ​	Design intelligent algorithms such as automatic pathfinding and obstacle avoidance, use something whose shape similar to our product with a camera to collect data for the algorithm training , we also use some open-source datasets such as cityscapes, etc. Depend on the well dataset and algorithm, we will develop a excellent system.

5. the system test and commissioning

   ​	Integrate the various parts of the completed development and test them. The test includes app and luggage connection test, luggage pathfinding, obstacle avoidance test and some hardware pressure resistance, waterproof and other tests.
